# Spotify Song Spy

## Introduction

## **Spotify Song Spy** is a program that i have written, which hooks into the name of a running instance of the windows Spotify client, in order to obtain the name of the currently playing song. It then will write the name of this song to a file called "spotifySong.txt".

I wrote this with the intention to use it with OBS Studio to display the song that is currently playing on spotify on my stream.
